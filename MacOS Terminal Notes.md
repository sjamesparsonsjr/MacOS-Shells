Bassic terminal commands for my Mac OS X

\>>> `sudo spctl --master-disable`

### This command lets you edit the bash tag
\>>> `vi .bash_profile`  [[or any note editor, nano]]
\>>> `vi .bashrc` [[for the header]]

### This command lets you disbale iTunes media key

(vi is a text editor, like nano)

OR
export PS1='\[\e[1;36m\] >> \[\e[m\] ' [[color coded]]
